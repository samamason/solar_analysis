# Solar Analysis Overview

===========================================================

This software provides tools to analyze the correlation between
a collection of properties related to a typical solar installation.

The main component being analyzed is weather, but in relation to this,
we are also looking at different solar equipment manufacturers to see
how resilient each is to the adverse affects of weather and general
poor solar conditions.

===========================================================

In order to gain a better understanding of how solar is affected
by weather, we will need to collect the following information:

# Site Information:
  + GPS Location / Address
  + Altitude

  For Each Array:
    + Number of Modules
    + Solar Array Tilt
    + Solar Array Azimuth
    + Solar Array TSRF

    + If shade is from trees:
      - Deciduous / Coniferous
      (What other information about the shade object can be collected here?)

# Solar Install Information:
  + Module Manufacturer
  + Module Wattage

  + Inverter Manufacturer

  + If Enphase:
    - Series of Micro Inverter

  + If SolarEdge:
    - Model of Inverter
    - Model of Optimizer
    - Number of Modules per Optimizer
